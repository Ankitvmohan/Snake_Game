#Snake Game

##Overview
<p> To give myself the nostalgic feeling of my childhood, I recreated the iconic Snake game that was more in trend during the early 2000s</p>

##Features
<p>- Interactive gameplay controlled via keyboard inputs.
- Dynamic food generation at random positions.
- Snake length increases after consuming food.
- Game over detection when the snake collides with itself or the walls.
- Easy to understand and beginner-friendly code structure. </p>

##Gameplay Instructions 
<p>
1. Start the game and control the snake using the arrow keys:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right
2. Guide the snake to eat the food (displayed as a green round dot) to increase its length.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body or else the GAME ENDS! </p>
