#Snake Game

##Overview
<p> To give myself the nostalgic feeling of my childhood, I recreated the iconic Snake game that was more in trend during the early 2000s</p>

##Features
<p>- Interactive gameplay controlled via keyboard inputs. <br>
- Dynamic food generation at random positions. <br>
- Snake length increases after consuming food.<br>
- Game over detection when the snake collides with itself or the walls.<br>
- Easy to understand and beginner-friendly code structure.<br> </p>

##Gameplay Instructions 
<p>
1. Start the game and control the snake using the arrow keys:
   - **Up Arrow**: Move up <br>
   - **Down Arrow**: Move down<br>
   - **Left Arrow**: Move left<br>
   - **Right Arrow**: Move right<br>
2. Guide the snake to eat the food (displayed as a green round dot) to increase its length.<br>
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body or else the GAME ENDS! <br></p>
